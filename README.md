# ChatFlow - The Chatting App

ChatFlow is a modern, real-time chatting application built using React, Vite, and a range of powerful technologies for seamless communication. It provides an intuitive and responsive interface, leveraging state-of-the-art tools for the frontend and backend.

## Technologies Used:

### Frontend:
- **React + Vite**: A fast, modern development environment powered by Vite, combined with React for building dynamic and interactive UIs.
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development, ensuring the app is responsive and customizable.
- **DaisyUI**: A plugin for TailwindCSS that provides a set of beautiful, pre-styled components, making UI design faster and more accessible.
- **Lucid React**: A state management library designed to make the React application easier to handle, with clean and predictable behavior.
- **Zustand**: A minimalistic state management library for React, which makes managing global state in the app smooth and efficient.
- **Socket.io**: A library to enable real-time, bi-directional communication between clients and servers, facilitating instant messaging.

### Backend:
- **ExpressJS**: A fast and minimal web framework for Node.js to handle API requests and real-time communication efficiently.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, making it easier to interact with MongoDB databases.
- **CookieParser**: A middleware to parse cookies attached to the client request, used for session management.
- **CORS**: Middleware to enable cross-origin requests, allowing the frontend and backend to communicate across different domains.
- **Hot Toast**: A library to show notifications and alerts in the app for a better user experience.

## Features:
- Real-time messaging with Socket.io.
- User authentication and session management using cookies.
- Responsive UI powered by TailwindCSS and DaisyUI.
- State management with Zustand for a smooth and efficient experience.
- Backend powered by ExpressJS and MongoDB, allowing persistent chat data.

# React + Vite App Installation Guide

This guide will help you set up a React application using Vite, install all necessary modules, and run the development server.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16 or higher is recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

You can verify these installations by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
# Or, if you prefer yarn:
yarn -v
git --version
```

---

# Installation Guidelines

### 1. Clone the Repository (If applicable)
If the project already exists on GitHub, clone it using:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```

If you're creating a new project, skip this step and move to step 2.

---

### 2. Create a New React + Vite App

Run the following command to create a new React project using Vite:

```bash
npm create vite@latest <project-name>
# Or, if you prefer yarn:
yarn create vite <project-name>
```

During the setup process, select the following options:
- **Framework:** React
- **Variant:** JavaScript or TypeScript (as per your preference)

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd <project-name>
```

---

### 3. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all required modules:

```bash
npm install
# Or, if you prefer yarn:
yarn install
```

---

### 4. Run the Development Server

Start the development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
# Or, if you prefer yarn:
yarn dev
```

This will start the application on a local development server. By default, it will be accessible at:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

---

### 5. Build for Production (Optional)

To create a production-ready build of your application, run:

```bash
npm run build
# Or, if you prefer yarn:
yarn build
```

The output will be located in the `dist` directory.

---

### 6. Preview the Production Build (Optional)

To preview the production build locally, use:

```bash
npm run preview
# Or, if you prefer yarn:
yarn preview
```

This will start a local server to serve the production build.

---

### 7. Push Changes to GitHub (Optional)

If you created a new project and want to push it to GitHub, initialize a Git repository and push your code:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin <repository-url>
git push -u origin main
```
